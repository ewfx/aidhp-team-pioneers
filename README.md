## 💡 Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from the growing need for personalized financial services that respect customer privacy and maintain ethical standards. Traditional recommendation systems often fall short in terms of fairness and transparency. We aimed to create a solution that combines advanced AI capabilities with strong ethical principles to deliver truly personalized financial recommendations.
