# AI-Driven Hyper-Personalization Recommendation System

An advanced Generative AI Model solution for hyper-personalization recommendations, focusing on financial services and business solutions. The system combines multiple AI techniques including multi-modal learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and risk assessment to provide personalized, fair, and ethical recommendations.

## Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Learning
- Combines numerical features, text data, and categorical variables
- Specialized encoders for each data modality
- Attention mechanisms for feature importance
- Unified representation fusion

### 2. Risk Assessment
- Real-time risk evaluation
- Transaction history analysis
- Sentiment-based risk factors
- Risk category classification (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

### 3. Bias Detection and Mitigation
- Continuous bias monitoring
- Automatic bias correction
- Fairness metrics tracking
- Demographic parity enforcement

### 4. Privacy and Compliance
- Data anonymization
- Consent management
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS)
- Data retention policies

### 5. RLHF Integration
- Human feedback collection
- Reward prediction
- Model updates based on feedback
- Continuous learning

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-hyper-personalization
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model

```bash
python src/train.py
```

The training script will:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Train the model with the specified configuration
- Save checkpoints and evaluation results
- Generate training reports

### 2. Generating Recommendations

```bash
python src/test_recommendations.py
```

This will:
- Load the trained model
- Process test data
- Generate personalized recommendations
- Evaluate performance and fairness
- Save results to artifacts/results/

### 3. Configuration

Edit `src/config/config.py` to modify:
- Model parameters
- Training settings
- Evaluation thresholds
- Privacy policies

## Model Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

### 1. Multi-Modal Encoder
- Customer Encoder: Processes numerical features
- Interest Embedding: Converts preferences to vectors
- Sentiment Analyzer: Analyzes text data
- Fusion Layer: Combines modalities

### 2. Recommendation Engine
- Recommendation Head: Generates personalized recommendations
- Bias Detection: Monitors and corrects biases
- Reward Predictor: Supports RLHF

### 3. Risk Assessment Module
- Risk Encoder: Processes features and sentiment
- Risk Score Head: Calculates risk scores
- Risk Category Classifier: Categorizes risk levels

### 4. Prompt Engineering
- Template System: Manages recommendation explanations
- Dynamic Generation: Creates personalized prompts
- Context Integration: Incorporates customer context

## Evaluation Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R² Score
- Recommendation Diversity

### Fairness Metrics
- Demographic Parity
- Equal Opportunity
- Bias Detection
- Fairness Scores

### Risk Metrics
- Risk Score Distribution
- Risk Category Distribution
- Transaction Risk Analysis

## Data Requirements

The system expects input data in the following format:
- Customer features (industry, revenue, employees)
- Preferences and interests
- Financial needs
- Transaction history (optional)

Example data format:
```json
{
    "customer_id": "ORG_US_001",
    "industry": "IT Services",
    "employees": "500-1000",
    "revenue": "50M-80M",
    "preferences": "Cloud Services, Employee Benefits",
    "financial_needs": "Business Loans, Payment Processing"
}
```
