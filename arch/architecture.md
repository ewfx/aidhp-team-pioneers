# AI-Driven Hyper-Personalization Recommendation System Architecture

## Overview
The system implements an advanced Generative AI Model for hyper-personalization recommendations, focusing on financial services and business solutions. It combines multiple AI techniques including multi-modal learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and risk assessment to provide personalized, fair, and ethical recommendations.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Processing Layer
- **DataProcessor**: Handles data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering
- **PrivacyManager**: Manages data privacy, consent, and compliance with regulations
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data quality and consistency

### 2. Model Architecture

#### 2.1 Multi-Modal Encoder
- **Customer Encoder**: Processes numerical features (industry, revenue, employees)
- **Interest Embedding**: Converts customer preferences into dense vectors
- **Sentiment Analyzer**: Analyzes text data for sentiment and context
- **Fusion Layer**: Combines all modalities into a unified representation

#### 2.2 Recommendation Engine
- **Recommendation Head**: Generates personalized recommendations
- **Bias Detection**: Monitors and corrects for potential biases
- **Reward Predictor**: Supports RLHF for continuous improvement

#### 2.3 Risk Assessment Module
- **Risk Encoder**: Processes numerical features and sentiment
- **Risk Score Head**: Calculates risk scores
- **Risk Category Classifier**: Categorizes risk levels
- **Transaction Analysis**: Analyzes historical transactions

#### 2.4 Prompt Engineering
- **Template System**: Manages recommendation explanation templates
- **Dynamic Generation**: Creates personalized explanations
- **Context Integration**: Incorporates customer context into prompts

### 3. Evaluation and Monitoring

#### 3.1 Performance Metrics
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R² Score
- Recommendation Diversity

#### 3.2 Fairness Metrics
- Demographic Parity
- Equal Opportunity
- Bias Detection
- Fairness Scores

#### 3.3 Risk Metrics
- Risk Score Distribution
- Risk Category Distribution
- Transaction Risk Analysis

## Data Flow
